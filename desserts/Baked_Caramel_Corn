Personal Notes:
I work with a half batch
Don’t use a small pot to make the caramel, it DOUBLES in size when it is boiling.
I use a disposable turkey-roasting pan.
Take out some of the pop corn and use (salted) peanuts, or any favorite nut.
When it is boiling, you don’t want it to be a hard boil, it can burn, you will need to figure out your own
heat setting. <<My electric stovetop, I put it between Med & Med high, equivalent to a clock 4:20>>
The stirring every 15 minutes gets everything coated, so don’t worry if it doesn’t look like all the corn is
coated when you first put it in the oven.

IT IS EASY! REALLY!
