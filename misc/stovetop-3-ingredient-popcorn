In large pot with a (clear) lid, 3 tbsp Ghee and 1/2 cup popcorn kernel, 
put on high heat and shake often. Pay atttention as kernal popping will happen 
fast, keep shaking, once popping slows down/stops, pull from heat and dump quick
 into a fresh bowl. Dont wanna burn it.

for seasoning, spoon in 2tbsp Ghee melted and drizzled on, and sprinkle 
with kosher salt to taste. It tastes better hours/24hours later?
