Carnitas

For the carnitas, these are the spices I use:
salt, pepper, cumin, paprika, cayenne pepper, dehydrated onion, and garlic. Sprinkle everything on the pork loin and rub it in.Throw the pork in the crock pot with a cup of chicken broth (I use chicken bouillon) and cook it on low for several hours or high for a couple. Depends on how much meat is in there...
Ingredients:


Oil (olive or vegetable or similar)
1/3 brown onion, chopped
5 medium carrots, chopped
Seasoned salt
10 small potatoes, chopped into 1/4's or smaller
Water (I used 3 of those square food storage containers in your cabinet)


Paprika
Onion powder
Cumin
Beef bouillon cubes (I used 4)

Chili powder
36 frozen meatballs

Instructions:
 1 Heat the oil in a large pot.
 2 Add the carrots and onions, sprinkle with seasoned salt, and simmer until the onion turns clear.
 3 Add the potatoes and water (I heated the water in the micro before adding to the pot).
 4 Cover and bring to a boil.
 5 Add paprika, onion powder, cumin, and beef bouillon cubes, and stir until dissolved.
 6 Add the frozen meatballs.  Sprinkle chili powder over the tops as they are floating at the top.  Let them sit like that for about 10 minutes, uncovered.
 7 Stir it all up... and eat.
