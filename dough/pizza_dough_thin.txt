K & N's thin pizza dough

measurements are by weight, made in a food processor

330g ap flour
6g salt
4g yeast

Pulse

30g cubed cold salted butter
170g 90 degree water

Pulse, and continue running until turns to pebbles. Like 15 seconds.

On a lightly flourerd clean counter, break it out, knead and roll into balls. 

Can be made rightaway, ideally set in fridge overnight, and pull out of fridge 2hours before you plan to use to let rise.

I make 3 even sized dough balls, which makes about 3 personal sized pizzas or calzones.
